From here, we created a MySQL database that we used for Users, Blogs, Comments and Reactions. <br><br>Using Object Oriented Programming, the blogging website includes a register feature which adds a new User to the database and a login feature which logs an existing user in. Users are able to create blog posts, comment on posts and determine whether they 'like' or 'dislike' posts. Any posts that have 1.5x the amount of dislikes are flagged as 'controversial'. <br><br>The front-end HTML and Tailwind CSS were provided, they are displayed using PHP. Unit tests were done using PHPUnit",
